This app use api http://www.floatrates.com/daily so sometimes it is slow when loading currency rates.
This app also check the internet before using and if user does not connect to the internet, system will use SharedPreferences to 
restoring currency values. On the other hand, user does connect to the internet, system will use SharedPreferences to save currency rates 
to use it when no internet found.
